#Samaritan. We completed this project as part of our Full Stack Flex Coding Program under UNC Chapel Hill.

#Motivation Our motivation behind the app is to create a fun and informative application that includes information on non-profits, sign-up to become a volunteer and for non-profits to join and create events. 

#Build status This is our first release with hope of future improvements.

#How this app works In this web application, log-in either with facebook or a modal for the non-profit.  The non-profit can post upcoming events which volunteers can see and sign up for.  The non-profit can also send text alerts to remind the volunteers of upcoming events.  The volunteer side is where individuals can find non-profits in their area and sign up for upcoming events. Here is the link of our Samaritan app:
